# 92 - Complete Game Rules

## Overview
"92" is a social deduction game where one player secretly has money in their briefcase, and the others must figure out who it is through discussion and deduction.

## Setup
- **Players**: 3-8 players (3 minimum to start)
- **Video Chat**: Players should be on a video call to see each other's reactions
- **Room Code**: Host creates a room and shares the 4-letter code

## Game Flow

### Round 1: Discussion & Elimination
1. **Assignment** (Secret)
   - One random player is told: "Your briefcase has the MONEY!" üí∞
   - All others are told: "Your briefcase is EMPTY" üíº

2. **Discussion Phase** (2 minutes for 3 players, +1 minute per extra player)
   - Players discuss and try to convince others they don't have the money
   - Players can lie, bluff, or tell the truth
   - Watch for tells, nervous behavior, or overconfidence!

3. **Voting Phase** (30 seconds)
   - Vote to eliminate one player
   - Cannot vote for yourself
   - Player with most votes is eliminated and can no longer speak

### Round 2: Final Deduction
1. **Discussion Phase** (Same duration as Round 1)
   - Remaining players continue discussing
   - Consider: Was the eliminated player acting suspicious? Too quiet? Too defensive?

2. **Final Vote** (30 seconds)
   - Vote for who you think has the money
   - Can vote for ANY player (including the eliminated player)
   - Cannot vote for yourself

## Scoring System

### If the eliminated player had the money:
- **Both remaining players guess correctly**: Each gets 1 point
- **Only one player guesses correctly**: That player gets 3 points
- **Nobody guesses correctly**: The money holder gets 3 points

### If an innocent player was eliminated:
- Same scoring rules apply based on who correctly identifies the actual money holder

## Game Modes
1. **First to 7**: First player to reach 7 points wins
2. **Best of 5**: Most points after 5 complete rounds
3. **Timed Match**: Most points after 15 minutes

## Strategy Tips

### As the Money Holder:
- Act natural - don't overcompensate
- Deflect suspicion subtly
- Create reasonable doubt about others
- Sometimes honesty can be the best deception

### As an Innocent:
- Pay attention to behavioral changes
