# 92 Game - Fixed and Ready! âœ…

## What Was Fixed

1. **Server.js Error**: The file was incomplete - missing the initial imports and setup code. Now fully restored with all necessary Socket.io initialization.

2. **Game Rules Clarified**: 
   - Players cannot vote for themselves (in both rounds)
   - Share link functionality added alongside room codes
   - Video chat reminder popup on startup

3. **New Features Added**:
   - Share links: `http://localhost:3000?room=ABCD`
   - Room codes can be shared via URL or typed manually
   - Better copy button functionality for both code and link

## How to Start the Game

1. **Quick Start**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/Ali/Coding/92-game
   npm start
   ```

2. **Open in Browser**: http://localhost:3000

3. **Test with Multiple Windows**:
   - Open 3+ browser tabs/windows
   - One creates a room, others join
   - Start playing!
